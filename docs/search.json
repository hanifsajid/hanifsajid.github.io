    "text": "Welcome!\nI am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for North Carolina Politics & Public Service at Catawba College, in collaboration with the School of Data Science at UNC Charlotte, working with Dr. Micheal Bitzer and Dr. Jason Windett. I am also affiliated with Politics, AI, & Data Science (PANDAS) lab and have been affiliated with the Public Opinion, Learning, and Sentiment Lab (POLS-Lab). I earned my Ph.D. in Public Policy from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where I pursued my studies as a Fulbright Scholar.\nI use artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to explore and solve complex problems in the social sciences. My primary research interests focus on research methods and comparative agendas for tracking policy activities. I specialize in computational social science, quantitative text analysis, and survey experiments. I am passionate about developing new interfaces, building effective data collection and annotation pipelines across disciplinary boundaries, and integrating diverse methods to better understand political and policy processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
