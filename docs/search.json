    "text": "Welcome!\nI leverage artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and traditional machine learning approaches, to address social science problems. My substantive research interests encompass political representation and comparative agendas aimed at tracking policy outcomes and congruence. Methodologically, I specialize in computational social science, quantitative text analysis, and survey experiments. I enjoy working at the intersections of disciplines.\nI am currently a PhD Candidate (ABD) in the Department of Public Policy at UNC Charlotte, NC, pursuing studies as a Fulbright Scholar. I am also affiliated with Politics, AI, & Data Science (PANDAS) lab and have been affiliated with the Public Opinion, Learning, and Sentiment Lab (POLS-Lab).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
